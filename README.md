# udacity-conditionals-quizes
All the quizes from Udacity's lesson on JavaScript Conditionals

These tasks are devoted to the topic of Conditionals.
1) If...else statements that allow to execute certain pieces of code based on a condition, or set of conditions, being met.
2) Else If statements that represent secondary condition by using an extra if statement.

Task "Musical Groups" is built using else if statemnts.
Its gpal is to meet the series of conditions, for example:
- To print "solo" if the amount of musicians is equal to 1
- To print "duet" if the amount of musicians is equal to 2
And so on.

Task "Murder mistery" basicaly has the same goal, but it is using more variables.
There are four rooms, four weapons and four suspects.

For the task "Checking your Balance" logical expressions and logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used.
Logical operators can be used in conjunction with boolean values to create more complex logical expressions.
By combining two boolean values together with a logical operator, it is possible to create a logical expression that returns another boolean value. 

Task "What do I wear" is basically built with logical expressions also, but it's operating more varibles and has more conditions to be satisfied.

The last task "Back to school" using switch statement instead of else...if.
A switch statement is an another way to chain multiple else if statements that are based on the same value without using conditional statements.
